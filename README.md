## Installation
NNLogic is written in Python, which means that all you need is the source code and a proper version of Python interpreter. NNLogic needs Python 3.x. If Python 3.x is not installed in your system, you can download it from here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

When Python 3.x is installed, download and unpack (if zipped or archived) the source code of NNLogic. You can use this link:

## Run NNLogic

In order to run NNLogic, run a terminal, change current directory to the one with NNLogic source files, and run either of the following two files using python3:
* nnlogic.py -- CLI interface of NNLogic;
* nnlogic_gui.py -- GUI (Tkinter) version of NNLogic.

For example, if you are using Linux, and the directory with NNLogic is `/home/johndoe/programs/nnlogic`, the following commands will run the GUI version of the program:

```
cd /home/johndoe/programs/nnlogic
python3 nnlogic_gui.py
```

Or you may want to use a single command:

```
python3 /home/johndoe/programs/nnlogic/nnlogic_gui.py
```
