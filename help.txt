NNLogic creates a truth table for a logical expression.
The expression can use parentheses and the following elements:

1 - True; 0 - False;
' - NOT (used after an operand); * - AND; + - OR;
^ - XOR (exclusive OR); ^' - XNOR; *' - NAND; +' - NOR;
A, B, C, ... Z - one-character variables

NOTE: NNLogic is case insensitive

No operand between variables is treated as AND (AB = A*B).
Maximum number of variables is 8.

EXAMPLE 1: (A^B)+'C+(AB)'+D
EXAMPLE 2: x + 'y
